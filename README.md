# NinthTest JCA Security Provider

The NinthTest JCA Provider is a security provider for the
[Javaâ„¢ Cryptography Architecture](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html),
focused on supporting candidate, reference, academic, and experimental
cryptographic algorithms and security services.

**Because the services provided by the NinthTest JCA Provider are
exploratory/provisional in nature, the NinthTest JCA Provider is _not_
recommended for use in security-critical applications or environments.**
